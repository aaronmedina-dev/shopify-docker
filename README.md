# Aligent Shopify Theme Development Template

## Description

Docker image for running the shopify-cli command without requiring it to be installed locally. It includes setup script, few custom shopify commands that simplifies working with Shopify themes via the shopify_wrapper, and yml file for integrating with Bitbucket Pipelines. 

## Limitations

Currently, this setup only supports Bitbucket Pipelines. If the client's repository is hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or others, the deployment pipeline functionality will not be available and would need to be configured separately.
