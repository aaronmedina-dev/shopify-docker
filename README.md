# Aligent Shopify Theme Development Template

## Description

Docker image for running the shopify-cli command without requiring it to be installed locally. It includes various utilities for configuring a local development setup, working with Shopify themes, and integrating with Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD processes. These tools streamline the development workflow by providing a Docker-based environment, simplified command-line utilities for interacting with Shopify themes.

## Limitations

Currently, this setup only supports Bitbucket Pipelines. If the client's repository is hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or others, the deployment pipeline functionality will not be available and would need to be configured separately.
